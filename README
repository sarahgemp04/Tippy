# Pre-work - *Tippy*

**Tippy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Sarah Gemperle**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

-[X] Background Color - Allows user to pick from two background colors and pick a default color.
-[X] More specific tip rate - using a step counter rather than segmented control, the user
     has the ability to pick a more specific tip rate value.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenges included reading up on how to track dates in Swift and how to 
calculate time intervals/how to implement code for this portion of the optional
assignment.
Also User Defaults was easier to figure out but also took a little time for 
reading and figuring out.
